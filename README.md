# psuniverse-web-app
web app to explore penn state football graph database

# Description

This is a Flask app that hooks into a neo4j database I have created, hosted on GrapheneDB. The database contains information on Penn State players and their relationships to other entities (high school, coaches, NFL Teams, etc..). The initial application simply allows for you to search for Penn State players on the roster since the 2009 season up till the present season by where they attended High School. I plan to quickly update the database to include more information and the application with more search functionalities.
